# Mixture of Experts (MoE) Architecture for PDF Extraction

## üß† Overview

The **Mixture of Experts (MoE)** architecture is a sophisticated machine learning approach that routes tasks to specialized "experts" based on the characteristics of the input. For our Lambda.hu AI system, this means intelligently selecting the most appropriate PDF extraction strategy based on document type, manufacturer, and content characteristics.

## üéØ Why MoE for PDF Extraction?

### Current Challenges
1. **Manufacturer Diversity**: ROCKWOOL, LEIER, and BAUMIT have different document structures
2. **Document Type Variety**: Technical datasheets, price lists, brochures, catalogs
3. **Quality Variations**: Different PDFs require different extraction approaches
4. **Processing Efficiency**: Not all strategies work equally well for all documents

### MoE Solution Benefits
- **Specialized Expertise**: Each expert optimized for specific document types/manufacturers
- **Intelligent Routing**: Automatic selection of the best extraction strategy
- **Quality Improvement**: Higher confidence scores through specialization
- **Cost Optimization**: Use expensive AI processing only when needed
- **Scalability**: Easy to add new experts for new manufacturers or document types

## üèóÔ∏è Architecture Components

### 1. Expert Types

#### Manufacturer-Specific Experts
```python
class ManufacturerSpecificExpert:
    """Expert specialized for specific manufacturer patterns"""
    
    # ROCKWOOL Expert
    - Optimized for ROCKWOOL document layouts
    - Recognizes FRONTROCK, MONROCK product series
    - Specialized thermal conductivity extraction
    - Hungarian technical terminology handling
    
    # LEIER Expert  
    - Optimized for LEIER performance declarations
    - Handles DURISOL, THERMOPLAN product lines
    - Specialized for concrete block specifications
    
    # BAUMIT Expert
    - Optimized for BAUMIT color systems
    - Handles Life and Star product lines
    - Specialized for facade paint specifications
```

#### Document-Type Experts
```python
class DocumentTypeExpert:
    """Expert specialized for specific document types"""
    
    # Technical Datasheet Expert
    - Table-focused extraction
    - Advanced specification parsing
    - Technical terminology recognition
    
    # Price List Expert
    - Table-heavy processing
    - Currency and pricing extraction
    - Bulk data handling
    
    # Brochure Expert
    - Text-focused extraction
    - Marketing content analysis
    - Image and layout processing
```

### 2. Gating Network

The **MoEGatingNetwork** is the "brain" that decides which expert(s) to use:

```python
class MoEGatingNetwork:
    """Intelligent routing system"""
    
    def route_task(self, task: ExtractionTask) -> RoutingDecision:
        # Analyze document characteristics
        # Score each expert's capability
        # Select optimal expert(s)
        # Return routing decision with rationale
```

#### Routing Logic
- **High Confidence (>0.8)**: Use single best expert
- **Medium Confidence (0.6-0.8)**: Use top 2 experts with consensus
- **Low Confidence (<0.6)**: Use ensemble of top 3 experts

### 3. Performance Learning

Each expert learns from its performance:
```python
class BaseExpert:
    def evaluate_performance(self, result: ExtractionResult) -> float:
        # Update specialization score
        # Track performance history
        # Adjust routing weights
```

## üìä Expected Performance Improvements

### Confidence Score Improvements
| Document Type | Current | MoE Expected | Improvement |
|---------------|---------|--------------|-------------|
| ROCKWOOL Technical | 0.75 | 0.90 | +20% |
| LEIER Performance | 0.70 | 0.85 | +21% |
| BAUMIT Color System | 0.65 | 0.85 | +31% |
| Generic Documents | 0.60 | 0.75 | +25% |

### Processing Efficiency
- **Faster Routing**: Optimal expert selection reduces processing time
- **Reduced Failures**: Specialized experts handle edge cases better
- **Cost Optimization**: Expensive AI processing only when needed

## üîÑ Integration with Existing System

### Seamless Integration
The MoE system builds on our existing architecture:

```python
# Current System
result = await existing_strategy.extract(pdf_path)

# MoE System
moe_orchestrator = MoEOrchestrator()
result = await moe_orchestrator.process_pdf(task)
```

### Backward Compatibility
- Existing extraction strategies become MoE experts
- Current `real_pdf_processor.py` wraps as specialist expert
- All existing data models remain compatible

## üìà Routing Examples

### Example 1: ROCKWOOL Technical Datasheet
```
Input: "ROCKWOOL_Frontrock_MAX_E_technical_datasheet.pdf"
Manufacturer: ROCKWOOL
Document Type: Technical Datasheet

Routing Decision:
- ROCKWOOL_expert: 0.95 confidence
- technical_datasheet_expert: 0.85 confidence
- Selected: ROCKWOOL_expert (single expert, high confidence)
- Rationale: "High confidence manufacturer match"
```

### Example 2: Unknown Manufacturer Price List
```
Input: "building_materials_price_list_2025.pdf"
Manufacturer: Unknown
Document Type: Price List

Routing Decision:
- price_list_expert: 0.80 confidence
- technical_datasheet_expert: 0.60 confidence
- brochure_expert: 0.40 confidence
- Selected: price_list_expert + technical_datasheet_expert (consensus)
- Rationale: "Medium confidence document type match"
```

### Example 3: Complex Multi-Manufacturer Document
```
Input: "construction_materials_catalog_mixed.pdf"
Manufacturer: Mixed
Document Type: Catalog

Routing Decision:
- Multiple experts: 0.40-0.60 confidence range
- Selected: Ensemble of top 3 experts
- Rationale: "Low confidence ensemble routing"
