# Mandatory Code Standards
- Always include TypeScript types for function parameters and return values
- Use meaningful variable names (no single letters except for loops)

# Error Handling Requirements
- All async functions must include try-catch blocks
- Log errors with appropriate context
- Never use empty catch blocks

# Testing Requirements
- All new functions require unit tests
- Test coverage must be > 80%
- Integration tests for API endpoints
